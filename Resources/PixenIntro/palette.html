	<p>Pixen's color palette is important to the creation of low and high-color sprite art alike. For the former, it will allow you to manage and change the colors you're using; for the latter, the palette lets you pick colors from predefined schemes to compose your images.</p>
	<p>Of course, you can pick colors from the normal Mac OS X color pickers, but Pixen also allows you to create and use lists of common colors. What's more, when you modify colors in an open document's palette, the image itself changes accordingly.</p>
	<p>To make a color active, simply click it. To change a color, drag a replacement color on top of it.</p>
	<p>The palette is filled with great features; to learn more, consult Pixen's help pages.</p>
