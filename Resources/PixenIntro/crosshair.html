	<p>Pixen's alignment crosshair lets you keep your images straight and place your pixels just here you want them to be. It expands to fit what you're drawing.</p>
	<p>Pixen's tool preview renders a preview under your cursor of what will be drawn if you click. Both of these options can be configured in the <strong>View</strong> menu.</p>
