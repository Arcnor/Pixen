	<p>Most tools have properties you can change to customize their behavior. You can open the Tool Properties panel by pressing Shift+Command+T or double-clicking a tool.</p>
	<p>Line width, fill style, and tolerance are some examples of tool properties you'll find.</p>
	
	<h2>Patterns</h2>
	<img class="left" src="patternscreen.png" alt="Patterns in Pixen" />
	<p>The pencil, line, and eraser tools allow you to draw a custom pattern to place (instead of a single pixel) while drawing. Just click the <strong>Set Pattern</strong> button in one of those tool's properties panels.</p>
	<p>If you make a pattern you like, you can keep it around for later use or share it with others. To export a pattern, just drag it out of the drawer.</p>
