	<p>Pixen also makes creating animations easy. Simply select <strong>New Animation</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to get started. The document window is split into two sections: a filmstrip and the typical image editor. You can edit the image per usual using all of Pixen's features.</p>
	<p>The filmstrip contains your animation's frames. Reorder and delete frames at will, or even drag cels between filmstrips. To change the duration of a frame, double-click the timestamp beneath it.</p>
	<p>To play back your animation, simply open the <strong>Preview</strong> window.</p>
	<p>Pixen can also import sequences of images and open animated GIFs; it can output animated GIFs, image sequences, QuickTime movies, and even sprite sheets!</p>
