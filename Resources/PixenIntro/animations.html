	<p>Simply select <strong>New Animation</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to get started. The document view is split into two sections: a filmstrip and the typical image editor. You can edit the image per usual using all of Pixen's features.</p>
	<p>The filmstrip contains all of your frames, as well as a preview, which constantly plays back your animation. Reorder and delete frames at will, or even drag cels between filmstrips.</p>
	<p>Pixen can read <i>pxa</i> files, sequences of images, and animated <i>gif</i>s; it can output <i>pxa</i> files, animated <i>gif</i>s, image sequences, QuickTime movies, and even sprite sheets!</p>
