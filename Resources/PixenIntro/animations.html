	<p>Simply select select <strong>New Animation</strong> from the <strong>File</strong> menu to get started. The document view is split into two sections: a filmstrip as well as the typical image editor. You can edit the image per usual using all of Pixen's features.</p>
	<p>A preview in the filmstrip constantly plays back your animation; the filmstrip contains all your frames. Reorder and delete them at will, or even drag cels between filmstrips.</p>
	<p>Pixen can read .pxa files, sequences of images, and animated .gifs; it can output .pxa files, animated .gifs, image sequences, QuickTime movies, and even sprite sheets.</p>
