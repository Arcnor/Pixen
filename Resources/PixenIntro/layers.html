	<p>Pixen is one of only a few pixel editors to support editing by layers. If you've never used them before, you're missing out -- layers allow for tremendous flexibility, even in pixel art.</p>
	<p>For instance, you can draw a character, then make a new layer for his clothing and draw it all in the new layer. Any changes you make afterward will only affect the new layer, so if you accidentally erase a few pixels, you won't be erasing colors in the original layer.</p>
	<p>A list of layers is displayed in the left pane of each document window.</p>
