	<h2>Right Tool</h2>
	<img class="left" src="righttoolbar.png" alt="Right Toolbar" />
	<p>Pixen allows you to choose independent tools and colors for the right mouse button. One example: pencil on the left; eraser on the right. Just click the disclosure triangle on the tool palette to get started.</p>
	<div class="clear"></div>
	
	<h2>Tiling</h2>
	<img class="left" src="tilingscreenshot.png" alt="Tiling" />
	<p>Pixen's powerful tiling mode allows you to work with your image as it's tiled across the window. You can use all of Pixen's normal features in this mode, and the program will repeat the image as many times as necessary to fill the window. Great for background images!</p>
