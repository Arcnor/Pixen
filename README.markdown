Compiling the Tip-of-Tree Build
-------------------------------

Mac OS X 10.6+ and Xcode 3.2+ are required to compile Pixen.
We recommend Xcode 4, which is available for free on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.7 "Lion" users.

1. Open Terminal (found in the "Utilities" folder inside your "Applications" folder) and `cd` into a folder in which you'd like to place Pixen's source tree. For example: `cd ~/Desktop`.
2. Issue the following command to pull the latest source code to Pixen: `git clone git://github.com/Pixen/Pixen.git`
3. Once the clone completes, open the Xcode project file found in the root directory of the source tree.
4. Hit the 'Run' button to compile and run a working build of Pixen.
5. To locate your build of Pixen in the Finder, expand the 'Products' group in Xcode's file navigator.
6. Right click on 'Pixen.app' and click 'Show in Finder'.
